### Search Engine Optimization

One key aspect of SEO is well organized content. Putting things in a logical order that is easy to read helps the user find what they are looking for. Appropriate semantic tags are a key aspect of this. While there is a tendency to myriad divs in order to organize the material on a page, I used semantic element as much as possible. This could possibly be further refined, but I think for the most part my page is fairly semantic. I used nav/header/aside/main tags as much as possible and divs as minimally as possible. 

Another pillar of SEO is mobile friendliness and accessbility. I am sure to keep my pages mobile friendly, and the page changes appropriately as the viewport of the user's device changes. I have tested each page on a laptop size, Ipad Pro, Ipad, and various mobile sizes. In some cases something that looks good on one mobile device does not look good on another, but I was sure to be thorough. In term of accessibility, I would add z indexes so someone who cannot see the screen easily can navigate more effectively. I also realized I could add alt tags to some of the images in my Trip Planner page, even though it would be very redunant. Its still important for disabled users. Another thing that could be improved is the bandwidth usage and loading. I'm not sure a user on dial up would be readily able to utilize my site. Perhaps there are some clever tricks I could add to make it more friendly for a user in such a position. This area falls under both the accessbility and performance categories.

Usage of metadata is also important for SEO. I added some metadata to my index page to help search engines find out more about my page and display it easily. It is enabled for social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Slack. Metadata is a convenient way to find out information under specific tags by search engine, and its important for any page in the modern era. 

Security is another factor. Netlify automatically adds an SSL. I had an SSL on my page before I deployed with Netlify and was able to sync them, so the page is fairly secure. There is no login so I don't need to encode passwords in anyway. There are other services that some sites online provide, so its possible that utilizing one of these resources would help the page. 

 Something we did not discuss in class that would be a good addition is optimization for voice search. There are several ways to achieve this. One is "long-tail keywords". This method involves adding a variety of related keywords to the content of a page. Another method is to structure data. Google offers a tool called "Structured Data Testing" that can be useful to achieve this. Additionally, targetting content based on the user's intent is important in SEO. This can be achieved by knowing your target audience and using keywords appropriately as well as good content organization. Lastly, there are tools available to find out the right keywords for your project. Using these services can help optimize a site for search enginges.
